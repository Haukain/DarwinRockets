    This simulation will build rockets that come closer to the objective generations after generations. It is meant to show application of genetics and evolution into algorithmics
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> 1- Click on ‘guided play’ and choose one of the available theme and sets</li>
    <li> 2- Have a look to the custom parameters prepared for the rockets (click help for more details)</li>
    <li> 3- Now look at the map: it shows the path where the rockets will perform (starting point, end point, planets, black holes..)</li>
    <li> 3- Fasten your seatbelt and click on ‘launch simulation’</li>
    <li> 4- The series of rockets created for the 1st generation on this play are created randomly. They are displayed with their timing score: blue rockets are the best ones, red the worst. The most performant ones will reproduce for the next generation, the better genes will be selected</li>
    <li> 5- Click on one rocket to see all its variables (you will be able to see rockets’ characteristics when and where their reactors worked) and see their flight!</li>
    <li> 6- Back on the rockets’ list, click on the bottom right to see the overall analytics of the current generation</li>
    <li> 7- You can now generate more generations through the upper navigation bar and see details of these new generations (once on the rockets’ list click on a blue rocket to see how they improved!)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This tutorial is meant for you to explore the game so we reveal just enough for you to start but not everything. Enjoy :)</p>
